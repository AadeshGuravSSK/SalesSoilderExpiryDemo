### üöÄ Running the Dashboard Locally

To view the dashboard, you need to run a local HTTP server to avoid CORS issues:

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd /path/to/SalesSoldierExpiry

# Start Python HTTP server
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Open your browser and go to:
# http://localhost:8000
```

**Important:** Do not open `index.html` directly in the browser as it will cause CORS errors. Always use the HTTP server.

The dashboard is also available on GitHub Pages at:
